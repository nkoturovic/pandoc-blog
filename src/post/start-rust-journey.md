# Why Rust?

This article is about the journey of a C++ developer into the Rust realm.

## Course of events

My Rust journey began three years ago, and I've now decided it's time to put 
into practice and level up what I've learned about Rust.

### First look

If you're a genuine C++ developer, hearing the word macro would cause strong symptoms of nausea,
and that is exactly how I reacted the first time I saw rust syntax and found out that `prinln!` is a macro.

```Rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

So, even in the most basic example of a program macros are involved. 
Being a C++ developer, I instinctively closed the tab and moved on with my life, rust sucks!

### Second look

As you know, the life of a C++ developer is tough, with lots of sweat and tears from 
compiler messages, bad overload resolutions, and missing `typename` keywords. 
But don't get me wrong, these are the perks of C++ that you can appreciate and relate to.

**TODO:** Rust advantages over C++ and wise versa

I couldn't pinpoint the time of first rust encounter, probably 
because it didn't leave a strong impression at first sight.

But I do roughly remember the first time I took a deeper look and realized that Rust was exciting.
It was Spring 2020, during the Covid 19 lockdown.
