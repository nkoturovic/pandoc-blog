# Why Rust in 2023?

This is an article about my journey as C++ developer into the rust realm.

## Course of events

### First look

If you're a genuine C++ developer, hearing the word macro would cause strong symptoms of nausea,
and that is exactly how I reacted the first time I saw rust syntax and found out that `prinln!` is a macro.

```Rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

Even in the most basic example of the program macros are involved, being a C++ developer you must 
turn the page and move on with your life, rust sucks!

### Second look

But as you know, life of a C++ developer is tough, lots of sweat and 
tears from compiler messages caused by bad overload resolution and missing `typename` keyword.

I couldn't pinpoint the time of first rust encounter, probably 
because it didn't leave a strong impression at first sight.

But I do roughly remember the first time I took a deeper look and realized that Rust was exciting.
It was Spring 2020, during the Covid 19 lockdown.
