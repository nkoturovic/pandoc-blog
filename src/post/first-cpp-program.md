# Hello world

`C++` [^fn1] is one of my favourite Programming languages.

 Okay let's write some `C++` code!

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {

    /* prints "Hello world" to console output */
    std::cout << "Hello world" << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

We can see C++ Logo on image bellow.
